> Traveler's Insight is not just a travel planning website; it's your passport to personalized journeys. Begin your adventure by discovering your unique travel personality, tailored to your preferences and interests. Uncover destinations that align with your spirit and style. Then, seamlessly transition from self-discovery to practical planning. Fine-tune your dream trip by adding specific details like budget and duration. With Traveler's Insight, every journey becomes a reflection of who you are, ensuring each moment is as extraordinary as you are.

### üöÄ [The Story](https://gotravelapp.netlify.app

I created Traveler's Insight out of a personal frustration with the overwhelming task of choosing the perfect vacation destination. With countless options and a myriad of activities, it's easy to feel lost in the sea of choices. By starting with your unique travel personality, Traveler's Insight transforms the planning process. Now, your vacation isn't just a destination; it's an expression of your mood and personality. No more generic getaways‚Äîimmerse yourself in experiences that resonate with who you are. Your dream vacation is just a personality quiz away with Traveler's Insight.

### üè† [The Project's logic](https://gotravelapp.netlify.app)

In this project, I‚Äôve chosen to use Next.js 13 and TypeScript, because during my Scrimba Front End development path I‚Äôve had no real interactions with these technologies. The application consists mainly of two components: a dynamic survey crafting a personalized travel personality and a robust travel planning interface. The survey, powered by a form, captures user preferences in areas like cuisine and nightlife during their travels. Leveraging the OPEN AI API, the system then assigns one of several pre-determined personalities based on the user's responses. With these newly acquired information, users proceed to customize their travel plan, inputting details like group size, budget, and current location. Here, too, OPEN AI‚Äôs api is used, generating a  travel itinerary. Behind these API connections, Netlify's serverless functions and environment variables are used.

### Built With

* Next.js 13:  The foundation of my website is built on Next.js 13, a powerful React framework that provides a robust structure for building modern web applications. Leveraging its latest features, Next.js enhances the performance and development experience.

* React: At the core of my website is React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Utilizing its component-based architecture, React enables the creation of dynamic and responsive web applications.

* OpenAI API: My website seamlessly integrates the OpenAI API, harnessing its capabilities for text processing, summarization, and generating practice questions. OpenAI's advanced models enhance the content creation and learning experience.

* Netlify Serverless Functions and Environment Variables: To secure sensitive information like API keys, I've employed Netlify's serverless functions and environment variables. This ensures a safe and efficient way to handle backend processes while benefiting from Netlify's hosting capabilities.
